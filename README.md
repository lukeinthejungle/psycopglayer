# psycopglayer

This repo is to help who is trying to creare a layer with psycopg and python 3.11

If you have version that are lower than python 3.11 you can find a lot of documentation online.

If you are trying to update psycopg to pyhton 3.11, you'll see that there are a lot of differences (no cpython file with versione hardcoded anymore, but .so file and binaries attached)

If you like this project, please star it, it will be appreciated!
